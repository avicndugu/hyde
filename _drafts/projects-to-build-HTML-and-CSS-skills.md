20 Projects to build with your HTML and CSS skills as a beginner

Question: what can i build with html
QUORA
It seems you are a beginner and you have just started learning web development. Good. I wish you all the best for your practice.

If you currently want to improve your HTML skills then I would recommend you to start designing some basic static webpages and website. Take any kind of static website project like coffee shop, Barber shop or some Baker shop etc, which just require their business information to be online. Through this you will improve your HTML skills. Apart from HTML you will also learn CSS so these kind of static websites will work for you as basic practice projects.

Now coming to the advance part. As you will be improving more so you would think of making some small and a little complex web applications like an online calculator or some basic game to begin with. Through this you will learn JavaScript and some other languages. These will come very handy in the future to you.
