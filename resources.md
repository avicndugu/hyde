<ol><li><h2 id="books">HTML and CSS Books</h2></li></ol>

- This book, <a href="https://amzn.to/3iOQOvG">HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites</a> by Jon Duckett, utilizes the power of illustrations and images to make learning HTML and CSS not a dry experience.

- I love <a href="https://amzn.to/3cdPvE6">Learn to Code HTML and CSS: Develop and Style Websites</a> by Shay Howe because Shay wrote it out of the experience of running a popular workshop. This meant that he had an understanding of the common hurdles every beginner trips over on their journey to learning HTML and CSS.

<ol start="2"><li><h2 id="courses">HTML and CSS Online Courses</h2></li></ol>

There alot of resources that can teach you HTML and CSS. Based on my experience, these courses offered on these websites are suitable and relevant for beginners.

<ol start="3"><li><h2 id="html-editors">Text/ Code Editors</h2></li></ol>

You will be using text editors to write HTML, CSS and Javascript. I recommend the following text editors.
- [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/) 
- [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)

<ol start="4"><li><h2 id="code-sharing">Code Sharing:</h2></li></ol>

When you need to share your code with others, you can use these two code sharing website.
- [Github gist](https://gist.github.com/)
- [Codepen](https://codepen.io/)

<ol start="5"><li><h2 id="web-hosting">Publishing Your Website online</h2></li></ol>

To take your website from your own computer and share it with the world, you need to publish it on a web server. A web host provides a web server, where you can publish you website.

You can use the following web hosts to publish your website online.
- [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/drop)
- [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [Bluehost](https://www.bluehost.com/track/devpractical): convenient for Wordpress website but can work for any other website.

<ol start="6"><li><h2 id="domain-name">Buy domain name</h2></li></ol>

You can buy your domain name from any seller. I use [Bitsimba](https://bitsimba.com/clients/aff.php?aff=22) to buy my domains. I use them because I can pay using Mpesa wallet.
You can also host a Wordpress or HTML website with them and get SSL without additional cost.

Remember, any host can sell you a domain name and then you can point it to your prefered host.
