best book to learn html for beginners

<ol><li><h2 id="books">HTML and CSS Books</h2></li></ol>

- This book, <a href="https://amzn.to/3iOQOvG">HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites</a> by Jon Duckett, utilizes the power of illustrations and images to make learning HTML and CSS not a dry experience.

- I love <a href="https://amzn.to/3cdPvE6">Learn to Code HTML and CSS: Develop and Style Websites</a> by Shay Howe because Shay wrote it out of the experience of running a popular workshop. This meant that he had an understanding of the common hurdles every beginner trips over on their journey to learning HTML and CSS.
