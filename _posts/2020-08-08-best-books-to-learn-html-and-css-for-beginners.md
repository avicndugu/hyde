Books are wonderful way to learn a new skill. You can learn the Basics of HTML and CSS from well written books in this subject. The two books I would recommend most are written by Shay howe, and Jon Duckett.

## Book 1: Learn to Code HTML and CSS: Develop and Style Websites by Shay Howe

I love <a href="https://amzn.to/3cdPvE6">Learn to Code HTML and CSS: Develop and Style Websites</a> by Shay Howe because Shay wrote it out of the experience of running a popular workshop. This meant that he had an understanding of the common hurdles every beginner trips over on their journey to learning HTML and CSS.

## Book 2: HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites</a> by Jon Duckett

This book, <a href="https://amzn.to/3iOQOvG">HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites</a> by Jon Duckett, utilizes the power of illustrations and images to make learning HTML and CSS not a dry experience.
