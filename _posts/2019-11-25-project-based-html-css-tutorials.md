There are a lot of courses that teach HTML and CSS online. However most of them usually teach based on the features of the languages.

I have nothing against that teaching method. It works. But not for everyone.

If you learn better by buiding products, you need a project based tutorial.

I created this list of tutorials to help you along the journey as you learn by creating real world projects. 

## 1. Dash Assembly [(Website)](https://dash.generalassemb.ly/)

Dash Assembly course teaches you HTML and CSS skills by creating 3 projects. The course takes you from knowing nothing to:
- Building a personal website
- Building a responsive tumblr theme
- Creating a small business website.
- creating a robot on the webpage using CSS  
- Creating a Madlib game

The last project, creating a Madlib game, will introduce you to the world of Javascript. This quiz project that you will be making can be played on the browser.

I once taught a class of 8-12 year old on making websites based on content from this course and they really enjoyed it. They particularly loved Making the robot using CSS project.
